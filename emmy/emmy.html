    <p>I decided to start what Emily unfortunately never got a chance to, which is this page on the webring.</p>
    <p>As of me writing this (3/7/2024), Emily is safe, in good hands and is trying to improve her life and has people there for her.</p>
    <p>She is now 24. She now has a cat called Queenie, being her second crucial companion.</p>
    <p>Emily is struggling with many things but is staying strong. She no longer drinks alcohol too.</p>
    <p>I want to dedicate this page to her as a reminder to all of you, that she's still alive, still kicking and will keep on kicking.</p>
    <p>Thank you everyone for your contributions. - Mia</p>
