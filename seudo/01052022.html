            <p>So, today I"ve made some research about HTML and CSS resources, but I got a <i>lesson?</i> 
            today from finesse privately over discord, thanks for that. Besides that, I couldn't do much research 
        today either, and I probably won't be able to do much in the following few days, but I just hope I 
        won't give up on this and I'll actually learn web development from finesse wanting to have a collective
        website :3 <br>I'll be updating my index page, and I'll probably add some more pages because my webpage
        sucks so far.</p>
